# Project Description
The purpose of this project is to build an application where bookworms can come together and have a space for a virtual bookclub in the comfort of your own home. You can navigate to sign up and create a profile. Once you're logged in, you can head over to the discussion page and spark up a new topic. This can be a certain topic or an interesting book that you've just finished. Users are able to go in and add comments and create discussions.
